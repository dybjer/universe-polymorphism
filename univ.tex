\title{Type Theories with Universe Level Judgements}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

The aim of this paper is to refine and extend proposals by Sozeau and Tabareau and by Voevodsky for universe polymorphism in type theory. In those systems judgments can depend on explicit constraints between universe levels. We here extend those systems with products indexed by universe levels and by constraints. Our theory has judgments for internal universe levels, built up from level variables by a successor operation and a binary supremum operation, and also judgments for equality of universe levels.

% The aim of this paper is to refine and extend Voevodsky's draft ``A universe polymorphic type system" that outlines a type theory where judgments can depend on equalities between universe levels expressions (constraints). We first recall a version of type theory with an externally indexed sequence of universes. We then add judgments for internal universe levels, built up from level variables by a successor operation and a binary supremum operation, and also judgments for equality of universe levels. Furthermore, we extend this type theory with rules for level-indexed product types. Finally, we add constraints to the theory, so that a hypothetical judgment can depend on equalities between universe levels. We also give rules for constraint-indexed product types, and compare the resulting type theory to Voevodsky's.

\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The system of simple type theory,
as introduced by Church \cite{church:formulation},
is elegant and forms the basis of several proof assistants.
However, it has some unnatural limitations:
it is not possible in this system to talk
about an arbitrary type or about an arbitrary structure.
For example, it is not possible to form the collection of all groups
as needed in category theory. In order to address these limitations,
Martin-L\"of \cite{ML71,ML71a} introduced a system with a type $V$ of all types.
A function $A\rightarrow V$ in this system can then be seen as a family of types
over a given type $A$. It is natural in such a system to refine
the operations exponential and cartesian product in simple type theory
to operations of dependent products and sums.
After the discovery of Girard's paradox \cite{Girard71},
Martin-L\"of \cite{ML72} introduced a distinction between
{\em small} and {\em large} types, similar to the distinction introduced
in category theory between large and small sets,
and the type $V$ became the (large) type of small types.
The name ``universe'' for such a type was chosen in analogy with the notion of
universe introduced by Grothendieck to represent category theory in set theory.

%% The earliest record of the use of universes in type theory that we could
%% find is in the paper \cite{deBruijn68} by de Bruijn on Automath.
%% In this paper, types are called categories, but not all categories are types.
%% Automath has a special symbol\footnote{PD: category?} \ttt{type} to make it possible to introduce
%% new categories, and only categories \ttt{c} introduced as $\ttt{c}:\ttt{type}$
%% are types, not \ttt{type} itself (so, not $\ttt{type}:\ttt{type}$).
%% One new type is $\ttt{bool}:\ttt{type}$,
%% which is the category of all propositions.
%% Propositions may or may not be asserted
%% and to this purpose there is a primitive notion\footnote{PD: category?} \ttt{TRUE}
%% of category \ttt{type}
%% in the context of a free variable of type \ttt{bool}.
%% By substitution one can form the type \ttt{TRUE(p)} for any $\ttt{p}:\ttt{bool}$.
%% In modern terminology we would call \ttt{type} a universe of
%% types and \ttt{bool} a subuniverse \emph{Ã  la Tarski} of
%% (codes of) propositions with a decoding function \ttt{TRUE}.
%% \footnote{PD: this seems similar to Per's view of type theory in 1985, just before he introduced the logical framework. Then he talked about "the category of types" and "the category of objects of a type". Among the types he had a universe U which could be formulated a la Tarski with T(a) the type of elements of a : U. How was  \ttt{TRUE(p)} defined? Is it similar to T(a)?}
%At the very end, the paper discusses the possibility of adding a symbol
%\ttt{type*} and changing the category of \ttt{bool} from \ttt{type}
%to \ttt{type*}, disallowing functional abstraction with respect to \ttt{bool}.
%The possibility of functional abstraction with respect to \ttt{type} is mentioned and rejected.

Later, Martin-L\"of \cite{martinlof:predicative} introduced a countable sequence of universes
$$
\UU_0 : \UU_1 : \UU_2 : \cdots
$$
We refer to the indices $0, 1, 2, \ldots$ as {\em universe levels}.

Before the advent of univalent foundations, most type theorists expected
only the first few universe levels to be relevant in practical formalisations.
One thought that it might be feasible for a user of
type theory to explicitly assign universe levels to their types and
then simply add updated versions of earlier
definitions when they were needed at different levels.
However, the number of copies of definitions does not only grow with the level,
but also with the number of type arguments in the definition of a type former.
(The latter growth can be exponential!)

To deal with this, Huet \cite{Huet87} introduced a specific form of
universe polymorphism that allowed the use of $\UU:\UU$
on the condition that each occurrence of $\UU$ can be disambiguated
%https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/Ambiguity.pdf
as $\UU_i$ in a consistent way.
This approach has been followed by Harper and Pollack \cite{HarperP91} and
in Coq.
%by Sozeau and Tabareau \cite{SozeauTabareau:coq}.
These  approaches to ``implicit" universe polymorphism are, however,
problematic with respect to modularity. As pointed out in \cite{Courant02,Simpson04}:
one can prove $A\rightarrow B$ in one file, and $B\rightarrow C$ in
another file, while $A\rightarrow C$ is not valid.

Leaving universe levels implicit also causes practical problems,
since universe level disambiguation can be a costly operation,
slowing down type-checking significantly.
Moreover, ``universe inconsistencies" can be hard to explain to the user.

In order to cope with these issues, Courant \cite{Courant02}
introduced explicit level universes,
with a sup operation (see also Herbelin \cite{herbelin05}).
Explicit universe levels are also present in Agda \cite{agda-manual} and
Lean \cite{moura:lean,Carneiro19}.
% and in Voevodsky's proposal \cite{VV}. 
However, whereas Courant has
universe level \emph{judgments}, Agda has a \emph{type} of
universe levels, and hence supports the formation of level-indexed products.
%

With the advent of Voevodsky's univalent foundations,
the need for universe polymorphism has only increased.
One often wants to prove theorems uniformly for arbitrary universes. These theorems may depend on several universes and there may be constraints on the level of these universes.
In response to this Voevodsky  \cite{VV} and Sozeau and Tabareau \cite{SozeauTabareau:coq} proposed type theories parameterized by
(arbitrary but fixed) universe levels and constraints. 

The \emph{univalence axiom} states that for any two types $X,Y$ the canonical map
$$
\idtoeq_{X,Y} : (X=Y)\to (X\simeq Y)
$$
is an equivalence.
Formally, the univalence axiom is an axiom scheme which is added to
Martin-LÃ¶f type theory.
If we work in Martin-LÃ¶f type theory with a countable tower of universes,
each type is a member of some universe $\UU_n$.
Such a universe $\UU_n$ is {\em univalent} provided for all $X,Y : \UU_n$ the
canonical map $\idtoeq_{X,Y}$ is an equivalence.
Let $\UA_n$ be the type expressing the univalence of $\UU_n$, and let
$\ua_n : \UA_n$ for $n = 0,1,\ldots$ be a sequence of constants postulating
the respective instances of the univalence axiom.
We note that $X = Y : \UU_{n+1}$ and $X\simeq Y : \UU_n$ and
hence $\UA_n : \UU_{n+1}$. We can express the universe polymorphism of these judgments internally in all of the above-mentioned systems by quantifying over universe levels, irrespectively if they have universe level judgments or a type of universe levels.

To be explicit about universes can be important, as shown by Waterhouse~\cite{waterhouse:sheaves,chambert-loir:universes-matter}, who gives an example of a large presheaf with no associated sheaf. A second example is the fact that the embedding
 $\Group(\UU_n)\rightarrow \Group(\UU_{n+1})$ of the type of groups in a universe $\UU_n$ into that of the next universe $\UU_{n+1}$ is not an equivalence. That is, there are more groups in the next universe~\cite{bcde:largegroup}.

 We remark that universes are even more important in a predicative framework
than in an impredicative one, for uniform proofs and modularity.
Consider for example the formalisation of real numbers as Dedekind cuts,
or domain elements as filters of formal neighbourhoods. Both belong to $\UU_1$ since they are properties of elements in~$\UU_0$.
However, even in a system using an impredicative universe of propositions,
such as the ones in \cite{Huet87,moura:lean}, there is a need for
definitions parametric in universe levels.

% (** Id U A B and Id U^+ A^+ B^+ **)

% There is a connection between the dimension of a type and the level of a universe: for example, it is natural to consider the groupoid structure of the first universe, the 2-groupoid structure of the second universe, etc.

%The starting point for the present discussions was Escard\'o's \cite{escardo} development of univalent mathematics in the Agda system. His development is {\em universe polymorphic} and makes heavy use of quantification over Agda's type $\Level$ of universe levels. However, the Agda system is not a precisely defined logical system, and we would like to introduce several candidate systems in which Escard\'o's development can be carried out.


\paragraph{Plan.}
In Section 2 we display rules for a basic version of dependent type theory with
$\Pi, \Sigma, \NN$, and an identity type former $\Id$.

In Section 3 we explain how to add an externally indexed sequence of universes
$\UU_n, \T_n~(n\in\Nat)$ \`a la Tarski, without cumulativity rules.
(In Appendix~1 we present a system with cumulativity,
and in Appendix~2 we present a system \`a la Russell.)

In Section~\ref{sec:internal} we introduce a notion of universe level,
and let judgments depend not only on a context of ordinary variables,
but also on level variables $\alpha, \ldots, \beta$.
This gives rise to a type theory with level polymorphism.
This is similar to ML-polymorphism as long as we do not bind those variables.
We then extend this theory with level-indexed products of
types $[\alpha]A$ and corresponding abstractions $\lam{\alpha}A$
to give full level polymorphism.

In Section \ref{sec:constraints} we extend the type theory in
Section~\ref{sec:internal} with constraints (lists of equations between level expressions). Constraints can now appear as assumptions in hypothetical judgments. Moreover, we add
constraint-indexed products of types $[\psi]A$ and corresponding
abstractions $\lam{\psi}A$. This goes beyond the systems of Sozeau and Tabareau \cite{SozeauTabareau:coq} and Voevodsky \cite{VV}.
%where the
%constraint set is fixed (but arbitrary) on the level of the type theory.
Finally, we %extensively
compare our type theory with Voevodsky's and Sozeau-Tabareau's
and briefly discuss some other approaches.

\paragraph{Summary of main contributions.}
Like Courant we present a type theory with
universe levels  and universe level equations as \emph{judgments}. Moreover, we don't restrict the levels to be natural numbers. Instead we just assume that they form a sup-semilattice with an inflationary endomorphism. In this way all levels are built up from level variables by a successor operation and a binary supremum operation. Unlike most other systems, we do not have a level constant $0$ for the first universe level. Thus all types involving universes depend on level variables; they are {\em universe polymorphic}.

Furthermore, we add
\emph{level-indexed products} in order to regain some of the expressivity Agda gets from having a \emph{type}
$\AgdaLevel$ of universe levels.
Finally, we present a type theory with constraints as \emph{judgments} similar to the ones by Sozeau and Tabareau \cite{SozeauTabareau:coq} and Voevodsky \cite{VV}  but extended with \emph{constraint-indexed products}.

\section{Rules for a basic type theory}\label{sec:basic}

We begin by listing the rules for a basic type theory
with $\Pi, \Sigma, \NN,$ and $\Id$. A point of departure is
the system described by Abel et al.\ in \cite{abel18}, since a
significant part of the metatheory of this system has been formalized in Agda.
This system has $\Pi$-types, $\NN$ and one universe.
However, for better readability we use named variables instead
of de Bruijn indices. We also add $\Sigma$ and $\Id$, and,
in the next sections, a tower of universes.

The judgment $\Gamma\vdash$ expresses that $\Gamma$ is a context.
The judgment $\Gamma\vdash A$ expresses that $A$ is a type in context $\Gamma$.
The judgment $\Gamma\vdash a:A$ expresses that $A$ is a type
and $a$ is a term of type $A$ in context $\Gamma$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Rules for context formation and assumption}\label{fig:context}
$$
\frac{}{()\vdash}~~~~~~~
\frac{\Gamma\vdash A}{\Gamma,x:A\vdash}~(x~\text{fresh})~~~~~~
\frac{\Gamma\vdash}{\Gamma\vdash x:A}~(x\!:\! A~\text{in}~\Gamma)
\belowdisplayshortskip 0pt
$$
\end{figure}

We may also write $A~\type~(\Gamma)$ for $\Gamma\vdash A$,
and may omit the global context $\Gamma$,
or the part of the context that is the same for all hypotheses and for the
conclusion of the rule.
Hypotheses that could be obtained from other
hypotheses through inversion lemmas are often left out,
for example, the hypothesis $A~\type$ in the first rule for $\Pi$ and $\Sigma$
in \cref{fig:PiSig}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Rules for $\Pi$ and $\Sigma$}\label{fig:PiSig}

\frac{B~\type~(x:A)}{\mypi{x}{A}{B}~\type}~~~~~~~~~
\frac{b:B~(x:A)}{\mylam{x}{A}{b}:\mypi{x}{A}{B}}~~~~~~~~
\frac{c:\mypi{x}{A}{B}~~~~~~a:A}
     {\app{c}{a}:B(a/x)}
$$
$$

\frac{c:\mysig{x}{A}{B}}{c.2:B(c.1/x)}
\belowdisplayshortskip -1pt
$$
\end{figure}


We write $\conv$ for definitional equality (or conversion).
The following rules express that conversion is an equivalence
relation and that judgments are invariant under conversion.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{General rules for conversion}\label{fig:conversion}
$$
\frac{ a:A~~~~~~ A~ \conv~ B}{ a:B}~~~~~~~~~

\belowdisplayshortskip 0pt
$$
\end{figure}

By now we have introduced several parametrized syntactic constructs
for types and terms, such as $\mypi{x}{A}{B}$,
$\mylam{x}{A}{b}$, $\app{c}{a}$, $(a,b).2$.
Conversion rules for $\Pi$ and $\Sigma$ were given in \cref{fig:convPiSig}.
and those rules imply that $=$ is a congruence.%
(Some cases of congruence are subtle. Exercise:
show congruence of $=$ for $\mylam{x}{A}{b}$ and $(a,b)$.)
In the sequel we will tacitly assume the inference rules
ensuring that $=$ is a congruence for all syntactic constructs
that are to follow.

We now introduce the type of natural numbers $\NN$ with
the usual constructors $\ZERO,\SUCC$ and eliminator $\RR$,
as an example of an inductive data type.
Rules with the same hypotheses are written as one rule with
several conclusions.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Rules and conversion rules for the datatype $\NN$}\label{fig:typeN}
$$
\frac{}{\NN~\type~~~~\ZERO:\NN}~~~~~
\frac{n:\NN}{\Sapp{n} : \NN}~~~~~~
\frac{P~\type~(x:\NN)~~~~a:P(\ZERO/x)~~~~~
g:\mypi{x}{\NN}{(P\to P(\Sapp{x}/x))}}
{\NRapp{P}{a}{g}{\ZERO} = a: P(\ZERO/x) }
$$
$$
\frac{P~\type~(x:\NN)~~~~a:P(\ZERO/x)~~~~~
g:\mypi{x}{\NN}{(P\to P(\Sapp{x}/x))}~~~~~n:\NN}
{\NRapp{P}{a}{g}{n}:P(n/x)~~~~~~\NRapp{P}{a}{g}{\Sapp{n}} = g~n~\NRapp{P}{a}{g}{n}: P(\Sapp{n}/x) }
%\belowdisplayshortskip 0pt
$$
\end{figure}

We also add identity types $\Idapp{A}{a}{a'}$ for all $A~\type$,
$a:A$ and $a':A$, with constructor $\Rfapp{A}{a}$ and (based) eliminator
$\Japp{A}{a}{C}{d}{a'}{q}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Rules and conversion rule for identity types}\label{fig:typeId}
$$
\frac{A~\type ~~~~ a:A ~~~~ a':A}{\Idapp{A}{a}{a'}~\type}~~~~~~~
\frac{a:A}{\Rfapp{A}{a}:\Idapp{A}{a}{a}}
$$
$$
\frac{a:A~~~~C~\type~(x:A,p:\Idapp{A}{a}{x})~~~~d:C(a/x,\Rfapp{A}{a}/p)
~~~~a':A~~~~q:\Idapp{A}{a}{a'}}
{\Japp{A}{a}{C}{d}{a'}{q}: C(a'/x,q/p) ~~~~~~~~
 \Japp{A}{a}{C}{d}{a}{\Rfapp{A}{a}} = d : C(a/x,\Rfapp{A}{a}/p)}
\belowdisplayshortskip 0pt
$$
\end{figure}

In this basic type theory we can define, for example,
$\isContr(A) := \mysig{a}{A}{\mypi{x}{A}{\Id(A,a,x)}}$
for $A~\type$, expressing that $A$ is contractible.
If also $B~\type$, we can define $\Equiv(A,B) :=
\mysig{f}{A\to B}{\mypi{b}{B}{\isContr(\mysig{x}{A}{\Id(B,b,f(x))})}}$,
which is the type of equivalences from $A$ to $B$. This example
will also be used later on.

\section{Rules for an external sequence of universes}\label{sec:external}


  %PD: Is this set of rules is complete? What about $A=A':\UU_n$ implies $\T_n(A) = T_n(A')$?} set of rules for "universes as full reflections".
%in the style of the rules in Section \ref{sec:palmgren}.
We present an external sequence of universes of codes of types, together
with the decoding functions. (We do not include rules for cumulativity here, but leave them for Appendix~1.)

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Rules and conversion rules for all universes $\UU_m$ and their codes $\UU^{n}_{m}~(n>m)$}\label{fig:typeU}
$$
\frac{}{\UU_m~\type}~~~~~~
\frac{A:\UU_{m}}{\T_{m}(A)~\type}~~~~~~
\frac{}{\UU^{n}_{m}:\UU_{n}~~~~~~\T_{n}({\UU^{n}_{m}}) = \UU_{m}}{~(n>m)}
\belowdisplayshortskip 0pt
$$
%\footnote{PD: wouldn't it be more natural to let $\UU^n$ be the code for $\UU_{n}$?}
\end{figure}

Here and below $m$ and $n$, as super- and subscripts of $\UU$ and $\T$,
are \emph{external} natural numbers, and $n \vee m$ is the
maximum of $n$ and $m$. This means, for example, that $\UU_m~\type$ is
a \emph{schema}, yielding one rule for each $m$.

Next we define how $\Pi, \Sigma, \NN,$ and $\Id$ are ``relativized'' to
codes of types, and how they are decoded.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Rules and conversion rules for $\Pi$ and $\Sigma$ for codes of types}\label{fig:PiSigU}
$$
\frac{A:\UU_{n}~~~~~~B:\T_{n}(A)\rightarrow \UU_{m}}
     {\Pi^{n,m} A B:\UU_{n\vee m}~~~~~~~~~
      \T_{n\vee m}~(\Pi^{n,m} A B) = \mypi{x}{\T_{n}(A)}{ \T_{m}(B~x)}}
$$

%% Note that $\UU_p, \T_p$ are given by separate inductive-recursive definition for each $p$. There is one introduction rule for each $\Pi^{n,m}$ and $\Sigma^{n,m}$ such that $p = m \vee n$ and introduction rules for $\NN^p, \Id^p$, and also for $\UU^{p-1}$ provided $p \geq 1$.

%Note that the universe levels in the above theory are
%\emph{external} natural numbers.
%Note that the typing of the identity function
%$$\mylam{X}{\UU_n}{\mylam{x}{\T_n(X)}{x}} :
%      \mypi{X}{\UU_n}{\T_n(X)\rightarrow \T_n(X)}$$
%is also a \emph{schema}  depending on the external natural number $n$.
%It has infinitely many instances obtained by letting  $n = 0,1,\dots$.

In the following section we present a type theory with \emph{internal}
universe level expressions. This theory has finitely many inference rules.

 \section{A type theory with universe levels and polymorphism }\label{sec:internal}

The problem with the type system with an external sequence of universes
is that we have to \emph{duplicate} definitions that follow
the same pattern. For instance, we have the identity function
$$
\id_n := \mylam{X}{\UU_n}{\mylam{x}{\T_n(X)}{x}} : \mypi{X}{\UU_n}{\T_n(X)\rightarrow \T_n(X)}
$$
This is a schema that
may have to be defined (and type-checked) for several $n$.
We address this issue by introducing \emph{universe level}
expressions: we write $\alpha,\beta,\dots$
for \emph{level variables}, and $l,m,\dots$ for
\emph{level expressions} which are built from level variables
by suprema $l \vee m$ and the next level operation $l^+$.
Level expressions form a sup-semilattice $l\vee m$
with a next level operation $l^+$ such that $l \vee l^+ = l^+$
and $(l\vee m)^+ = l^+\vee m^+$. (We don't need a $0$ element.)
We write $l\leqslant m$ for $l\vee m = m$ and $l<m$ for $l^+\leqslant m$.
See \cite{bezem-coquand:lattices} for more details.

%As expressed in \cite{VV}, this is essentially a tropical (max-plus)
%semiring, except that we don't actually seem to need a $0$ element.

We have a new context extension operation that adds a fresh level variable
$\alpha$ to a context, a rule for assumption, and typing rules
for level expressions.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Rules for typing level expressions, extending
  \cref{fig:context}}\label{fig:contextL}
$$
\frac{\Gamma\vdash}{\Gamma,\alpha~\Level\vdash}~(\alpha~\text{fresh})~~~~~~
\frac{\Gamma\vdash}{\Gamma\vdash\alpha~\Level}(\alpha~\text{in}~\Gamma)~~~~~~
\frac{l~\Level~~~~~m~\Level}{l\vee m~\Level}~~~~~~
\frac{l~\Level}{l^+~\Level}
\belowdisplayshortskip 0pt
$$
\end{figure}

We also have level equality judgments $\Gamma\vdash l = m$
and want to enforce that judgments are invariant under level equality.
To this end we add the rule that $\Gamma\vdash l = m$
when $\Gamma\vdash l~\Level$ and $\Gamma\vdash m~\Level$ and
$l=m$ in the free sup-semilattice above with $\_^+$ and generators
(level variables) in $\Gamma$.

In the next section we will also consider \emph{hypothetical} level
equality judgments, i.e., we may have constraints in $\Gamma$,
quotienting the free sup-semilattice above.

We tacitly assume additional %congruence
rules ensuring that level equality
implies definitional equality of types and terms.
It then follows from the rules of our basic type theory that
judgments are invariant under level equality: if $l=m$ and
${a(l/\alpha) : A(l/\alpha)}$, then ${a(m/\alpha) : A(m/\alpha)}$.

We will now add rules for internally indexed universes.
Note that $l<m$ is shorthand for the level equality judgment
$m= l^+ \vee m$.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Rules and conversion rule for universes $\UU_l$ and their codes}\label{fig:typeUl}
$$
\frac{l~\Level}{\UU_l~\type}~~~~~~
\frac{A:\UU_{l}}{\T_{l}(A)~\type}~~~~~~
\frac{l<m}{\UU^{m}_{l}:\UU_{m}~~~~~~\T_{m}({\UU^{m}_{l}}) = \UU_{l}}
\belowdisplayshortskip 0pt
$$
\end{figure}

The remaining rules are completely analogous to the rules in
\cref{fig:PiSigU} and \cref{fig:NIdU}
for externally indexed universes with external numbers replaced
by internal levels. (To rules without assumptions, such as the first two
in Fig.~\ref{fig:NIdU}, we need to add assumptions like $n~\Level$,
for other rules these assumptions can be obtained from inversion lemmas.)

 We expect that normalisation holds for this system.
 This would imply decidable type-checking.
 This would also imply that if $a : \NN$ in a context with only
 level variables, then $a$ is convertible to a numeral.
 %See Section~\ref{sec:future} for a list of conjectures and open problems.

%% As we mentioned in the introduction, we have now got a system in which we can express univalence of all universes as one typing
%% $$
%% \ua : (l : \Level) \to \UA_l
%% $$
%% since the type $(l : \Level) \to \UA_l$ is well-formed in the present system.
% and the
% fact that if all universes are univalent then they all satisfy function extensionality.

\paragraph{Interpreting the level-indexed system in the system with externally indexed universes.}

A judgment in the level-indexed system can be interpreted in the externally indexed system relative to an assignment $\rho$ of external natural numbers to level variables. We simply replace each level expression in the judgment by the corresponding natural number obtained by letting $l^+\,\rho = l\,\rho+1$ and $(l \vee m)\,\rho = \max(l\,\rho,m\,\rho)$.

\subsection*{Rules for level-indexed products}

In Agda $\AgdaLevel$ is a type,
and it is thus possible to form level-indexed products of types as $\Pi$-types.
In our system this is not possible, since $\Level$ is not a type. Nevertheless, it is useful for modularity to be able to form level-indexed products. Thus we extend the system with the following rules:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Rules and conversion rule for level-indexed products}%
  \label{fig:levindprod}
$$
\frac{A~\type~(\alpha~\Level)}{[\alpha]A~\type}~~~~~~~
\frac{t:[\alpha]A~~~~~l~\Level}
     {t~l:A(l/\alpha)}~~~~~~~~~
\frac{u:A~(\alpha~\Level)}{\lam{\alpha}{u}: [\alpha]A}~~~~~
\frac{t~\alpha = u~\alpha:A~(\alpha~\Level)}{t = u:[\alpha]A}
$$
$$
\frac{u:A~(\alpha~\Level)~~~~~l~\Level}
{(\lam{\alpha}{u})~l = u(l/\alpha): A(l/\alpha)}
$$
\end{figure}

In this type theory we can reflect, for example, $\isContr(A) :=
\mysig{a}{A}{\mypi{x}{A}{\Id(A,a,x)}}$ for $A~\type$ as follows.
In the context $\alpha\,\Level, A: \UU_\alpha$, define
\[
\isContr^\alpha(A) :=
\Usig{\alpha,\alpha}{A}{(\mylam{a}{\T_\alpha(A)}
{(\Upi{\alpha,\alpha}{A}{(\mylam{x}{\T_\alpha(A)}{\Id^\alpha(A,a,x)})})})}.
\]
Then $\T_\alpha (\isContr^\alpha(A)) = \isContr(\T_\alpha(A))$.
We can further abstract to obtain the following typing:
\[
\lam{\alpha}{\mylam{A}{\UU_\alpha}{\isContr^\alpha(A)}} :
[\alpha](\UU_\alpha \to \UU_\alpha).
\]
In a similar way we can reflect $\Equiv(A,B)$ for $A,B\,\type$ by defining
in context $\alpha\,\Level,\beta\,\Level$, $A: \UU_\alpha, B: \UU_\beta$
a term $\Eq^{\alpha,\beta}(A,B) : \UU_{\alpha\vee\beta}$
such that $\T_{\alpha\vee\beta}(\Eq^{\alpha,\beta}(A,B))=
\Equiv(\T_{\alpha}(A),\T_{\beta}(B))$.

An example that uses level-indexed products beyond the ML-polymorphism (provided by Sozeau and Tabareau and by Voevodsky)
is the following type which
expresses the theorem that univalence for universes of arbitrary level implies
function extensionality for functions between universes of arbitrary levels.
$$
([\alpha]\mathsf{IsUnivalent}\, \UU_\alpha)
\to [\beta][\gamma] \mathsf{FunExt}\, \UU_\beta\, \UU_\gamma
$$
In other words, {\em global} univalence  implies {\em global} function extensionality. 

Since an assumption of global function extensionality can replace many assumptions of local function extensionality (provided by the ML-polymorphism), this can also give rise to shorter code, see the following example from Escard\'o's library of univalent mathematics in Agda:
%https://
\begin{verbatim}
www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/HoTT-UF-Agda.html#275277
\end{verbatim}

One can roughly describe the type system of Lean \cite{moura:lean,Carneiro19} as the current type system
where we only can declare constants of the form
$c~=~\lam{\alpha_1~\dots~\alpha_n}M~~:~~[\alpha_1~\dots~\alpha_n]A$ where there are no level declarations in $A$ and $M$.



%\paragraph{Interpreting the system with levels into extensional type theory with a super universe.} We can interpret the theory with rules for level-indexed products in extensional type theory with a (minimal) super universe, provided we add the rules for cumulativity. Levels will be interpreted by internal natural numbers $n : \NN$, and level-indexed products $[\alpha]A$ will be interpreted by ordinary indexed products $\Pi_{n : \NN}A$. Level application and level abstraction will be interpreted as ordinary application and abstraction.

%In intensional type theory we will not be able to justify all the laws for level expressions as definitional equalities. For example, we do not have $\max(m,n)=\max(n,m)$ definitionally.

\section{A system with level constraints}\label{sec:constraints}

To motivate why it may be useful to introduce the notion of judgment relative to a list of constraints on universe levels, consider the following type in a system without cumulativity. (We use Russell style notation for readability, see Appendix 2 for the rules for the Russell style version of our system.)

$$
    \Pi_{A:\UU_l~{B}:{\UU_m}~{C}:{\UU_n}}
    {~~\Id\,\UU_{l \vee m}\, (A\times B)\,(C \times A)
    \to \Id\,\UU_{m \vee l} \, (B\times A)\,(C \times A)}
%    \to A \times B =_\delta C \times A \to B \times A =_\epsilon C \times A
$$
This is well-formed provided $l \vee m = n \vee l$.
There are three maximally general solutions:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&l = \alpha, m = \beta, n = \alpha \vee \beta\\
&&l = \alpha, m = \gamma \vee \alpha, n = \gamma\\
&&l = \beta \vee \gamma, m = \beta, n = \gamma
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\alpha, \beta,$ and $\gamma$ are level
variables. (Note the similarity with the Gustave function
in stable domain theory.)

In a system with level constraints,
we could instead derive the (inhabited under $\UA$) type
$$
    \Pi_{A:\UU_\alpha~{B}:{\UU_\beta}~{C}:{\UU_\gamma}}
    {~~\Id\,\UU_{\alpha \vee \beta}\, (A\times B)\,(C \times A)
    \to \Id\,\UU_{\alpha \vee \gamma}\, (B\times A)\,(C \times A)}
$$
which is valid under the constraint
$\alpha \vee \beta = \alpha \vee \gamma$,
which captures all solutions simultaneously.

Since such constraints are not available in Agda and Lean
one would instead need to write three separate definitions.

\subsection*{Rules for level constraints}%\label{ssec:VVsystem}

A constraint is an equation $l = m$, where $l$ and $m$ are level expressions.
Voevodsky \cite{VV} suggested to introduce universe levels with
constraints. This corresponds to mathematical practice:
for instance, at the beginning of the book \cite{giraud:cohom-non-abel},
the author introduces two universes $U$ and $V$ with the constraint
that $U$ is a member of $V$.
In our setting this will correspond to introducing two levels
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ with the constraint $\alpha<\beta$.

Note that $\alpha < \beta$ holds iff $\beta = \beta \vee\alpha^+$.
We can thus avoid declaring this constraint if we instead
systematically replace $\beta$ by $\beta\vee\alpha^+$.
This is what is currently done in the system Agda.
However, this is a rather indirect way to express what is
going on. Furthermore, the example at the beginning of this section
shows that this can lead to an artificial duplication of definitions.

Recall that we have in Section~\ref{sec:internal}, e.g., the rule
that $\UU^m_l:\UU_m$ if $l<m~\valid$, that is, if
$l<m$ holds in the free semilattice. %\frac{l<m}{\UU^m_l:\UU_m}
In the extended system in this section, this typing rule also applies
when $l<m$ is implied by the constraints in the context $\Gamma$.
For instance, we have $\alpha^+\leqslant\beta$ in a context
with constraints $\alpha\leqslant\gamma$ and $\gamma^+\leqslant\beta$.

To this end we introduce a new context extension operation $\Gamma,\psi$
extending a context $\Gamma$ by a finite set of constraints $\psi$.
The first condition for forming $\Gamma,\psi$ is that all level variables
occurring in $\psi$ are declared in $\Gamma$. The second condition
is that the finite set of constaints in the extended context
$\Gamma,\psi$ is loop-free.
A finite set of constraints is {\em loop-free} if it does not
create a {\em loop}, i.e., a level expression $l$ such that $l<l$
modulo this set of constraints, see \cite{bezem-coquand:lattices}.

%\begin{figure}[H]
%  \caption{Rule for context extension with constraints}\label{fig:Gpsi}
%$$
%\frac{\Gamma\vdash}{\Gamma,\psi\vdash}~~
%(\Gamma,\psi~\text{loop-free, variables in $\psi$ declared in $\Gamma$})
%\belowdisplayshortskip 0pt
%$$
%\end{figure}

We also have a new judgment form $\Gamma\vdash\psi~\valid$ that expresses
that the constraints in $\psi$ hold in $\Gamma$, that is,
are implied by the constraints in $\Gamma$. If there are
no constraints in $\Gamma$, the judgment $\Gamma\vdash\set{l=m}~\valid$
amounts to the same as $\Gamma\vdash l=m$ in Section~\ref{sec:internal}.
Otherwise it means that the constraints in $\psi$ hold in the
sup-semilattice with $\_^+$ presented by $\Gamma$.

As shown in \cite{bezem-coquand:lattices}, $\Gamma\vdash\psi~\valid$
as well as loop-checking, is decidable in polynomial time.


Voevodsky \cite {VV} did not describe a mechanism to {\em eliminate}
universe levels and constraints. In Figure~\ref{fig:levindprod} we
gave rules for eliminating universe levels
and in Figure~\ref{fig:restriction} below we give rules
for eliminating universe level constraints.

\subsection*{Rules for constraint-indexed products}%\label{ssec:VVsystem}
We introduce a ``restriction'' or ``constraining'' operation with
the following rules:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Rules for constraining}%
  \label{fig:restriction}
$$
\frac{A~\type~~(\psi)}{[\psi]A~\type}~~~~~~~~~
\frac{{t}:A~~(\psi)}{\lam{\psi}{t}:[\psi]A}~~~~~~~~~
\frac{\psi~\valid}{[\psi]A = A}~~~~~~~~~
\frac{\psi~\valid}{\lam{\psi}{t} = t}
\belowdisplayshortskip 1pt
$$
\end{figure}


Here is a simple example of the use of this system.
In order to represent set theory in type
theory, we can use a type $V$ satisfying the following equality $\Id~{\UU_{\beta}}~V~(\Sigma_{X:\UU_{\alpha}}X\rightarrow V)$.
This equation is only well-typed modulo the constraint $\alpha<\beta$.

We can define in our system a constant
$$
c~=~\lam{\alpha~\beta}\lam{\alpha<\beta}\lambda_{Y:\UU_{\beta}}\Id~{\UU_{\beta}}~Y~ (\Sigma_{X:\UU_{\alpha}}X\rightarrow Y)~~:~~
   [\alpha~\beta][\alpha<\beta]\UU_{\beta} \rightarrow \UU_{\beta^+}
$$

   This is because $\Sigma_{X:\UU_{\alpha}}X\rightarrow Y$ has type $\UU_{\beta}$ in the context

   $$\alpha:\Level,~\beta:\Level,~\alpha<\beta,~Y:\UU_{\beta}$$

   We can further instantiate this constant $c$ on two levels $l$ and $m$, and this will be of type
   $$[l<m]\UU_{m} \rightarrow \UU_{m^+}$$
   and this can only be used further if $l<m$ holds in the current
   context\footnote{It is interesting to replace $\Id~\UU_\beta$ in the
   definition of
$c$ above by $\Eq$. We leave it to the reader to verify the
following typing, for which no constraint is needed:
$$
c'~=~\lam{\alpha~\beta}\lambda_{Y:\UU_{\beta}}~\Eq~Y~ (\Sigma_{X:\UU_{\alpha}}X\rightarrow Y)~~:~~
   [\alpha~\beta]\UU_{\beta} \rightarrow \UU_{\beta\vee\alpha^+}
$$}.

\medskip


In the current system of Agda, the constraint $\alpha<\beta$ is represented indirectly by
writing $\beta$ on the form $\gamma\vee \alpha^+$ and $c$ is defined as
$$
c~=~\lam{\alpha~\gamma}\lambda_{Y:\UU_{\alpha^+\vee\gamma}}\Id~{\UU_{\alpha^+\vee\gamma}}~Y~ (\Sigma_{X:\UU_{\alpha}}X\rightarrow Y)~~:~~
   [\alpha~\gamma]\UU_{\alpha^+\vee\gamma} \rightarrow \UU_{\alpha^{++}\vee\gamma^+}
$$
   which arguably is less readable.

\medskip

In general, if we  build a term $t$ of type $A$ in a context using labels $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_m$
and constraint $\psi$ and variables $x_1:A_1,\dots,x_n:A_n$ we can introduce a constant
$$
c~=~ \lam{\alpha_1~\dots~\alpha_m}\lam{\psi}\lambda_{x_1~\dots~x_n}t ~:~
[\alpha_1~\dots~\alpha_m][\psi]\Pi_{x_1:A_1~\dots~x_n:A_n}A
$$
We can then instantiate this constant $c~l_1~\dots~l_m~u_1~\dots~u_n$, but only if the levels
$l_1~\dots~l_m$ satisfy the constraint $\psi$.

We remark that Voevodsky's system \cite{VV} has no constraint-indexed products and no associated application operation, and instantiation of levels is only a meta-level operation. Sozeau and Tabareau \cite{SozeauTabareau:coq} do not have constraint-index products either. However, they do have a special operation %(CONSTANT) 
 for instantiating universe-polymorphic constants defined in the global environment.
%    We have thus complemented Voevodsky's proposal \cite{VV}: we can not only declare and define
%    constants assuming universe levels satisfying some constraints, but we also provide a mechanism
%    to {\em instantiate} these constants.
%

%% Here is an example showing how such a system can be used. With univalence, we can build a term $t$
%% $$
%% t~:~    \Pi_{A:\UU_\alpha~{B}:{\UU_\beta}~{C}:{\UU_\gamma}}[\alpha \vee \beta = \alpha \vee \gamma]
%%     {~~\Id\,\UU_{\alpha \vee \beta}\, (A\times B)\,(C \times A)
%%     \to \Id\,\UU_{\alpha \vee \gamma}\, (B\times A)\,(C \times A)}
%% $$

%%     We can then define $u = \lam{\alpha~\beta~\gamma}t$ which is of type
%%     $$[\alpha~\beta~\gamma][\psi]\Pi_{A:\UU_\alpha~{B}:{\UU_\beta}~{C}:{\UU_\gamma}}
%%     {~~\Id\,\UU_{\alpha \vee \beta}\, (A\times B)\,(C \times A)
%%     \to \Id\,\UU_{\alpha \vee \gamma}\, (B\times A)\,(C \times A)}
%% $$
%%     where $\psi$ is $\alpha \vee \beta = \alpha \vee \gamma$.

%%     It is now possible to instantiate this general operation to levels $u~l~m~n$. This has type
%%     $$[\psi(l,m,n)]\Pi_{A:\UU_l~{B}:{\UU_m}~{C}:{\UU_n}}
%%     {~~\Id\,\UU_{l \vee m}\, (A\times B)\,(C \times A)
%%     \to \Id\,\UU_{l \vee n}\, (B\times A)\,(C \times A)}
%% $$
%%     If $\psi(l,m,n)$ holds, i.e. $l,m,n$ satisfy the constraint $\psi$, we can instantiate
%%     further $u~l~m~n$ to $A:\UU_l,B:\UU_m,C:\UU_n$
%%     $$u~l~m~n~A~B~C~:~    {~~\Id\,\UU_{l \vee m}\, (A\times B)\,(C \times A)
%%     \to \Id\,\UU_{l \vee n}\, (B\times A)\,(C \times A)}$$

%% %Intuitively, we can use a term of type $[\psi]A$ only if all constraints in $\psi$ hold.


\begin{remark}
Let's discuss some special cases and variations.

First, it is possible not to use
level variables at all, making the semilattice empty,
in which case the type theory defaults to one without universes
as presented in Section~\ref{sec:basic}.

Second, one could have exactly one level variable in the context.
Then any constraint would either be a loop or trivial.
In the latter case, the finitely presented semilattice
is isomorphic to the natural numbers with successor and $\max$.
Still, we get some more
expressivity than the type theory in Section~\ref{sec:external} since
we can express universe polymorphism in one variable.

Third, with arbitrarily many level variables but not using constraints
we get the type theory in Section~\ref{sec:internal}.

Fourth, we could add a bottom element, or empty supremum, to the semilattice.
Without level variables and constraints, the finitely presented semilattice
is isomorphic to the natural numbers with successor and $\max$
and we would get the type theory in Section~\ref{sec:external}.
We would also get a first universe.
(Alternatively, one could have one designated level variable
$\o$ and constraints $\o\leqslant\alpha$
for all level variables $\alpha$.)

Fifth, we note in passing that the one-point semilattice
with $\_^+$ has a loop.
%, and hence we cannot represent a universe that is a member of itself.
\end{remark}

\section{Related work}\label{sec:related}

\paragraph{Agda.} Our original aim was to provide an alternative to Agda's approach to universe polymorphism, but without a {\em type} of universe levels. We wanted to present a system powerful enough to serve as a theoretical foundation of Escard\'o's library of univalent mathematics in Agda. 

To this end, we introduced new judgments for universe levels. In order to compensate for some of the lost expressivity we added product types indexed by universe levels. We also added an approach to constraints and constraint-indexed products that has no counterpart in Agda.

\paragraph{Voevodsky.} One of our starting points was the 79 pp.\ draft \cite{VV} by Voevodsky, where type theories are parametrized by a fixed but arbitrary finite set of constraints over a given finite
set $\Fu$ of \emph{u-level variables}. A \emph{u-level expression} \cite[Def. 2.0.2]{VV} is either a numeral,
or a variable in $\Fu$, or an expression of the form $M+n$ with $n$
a numeral and $M$ a u-level expression, or of the form $\max(M_1,M_2)$
with $M_1,M_2$ u-level expression. A \emph{constraint} is an equation
between two u-level expressions. Given the finite set of constraints,
$\AFu$ is the set of assigments of natural numbers to variables
in $\Fu$ that satisfy all constraints.

The rules 7 and 10 in \cite[Section 3.4]{VV} define how to use constraints:
two types (and, similarly, two terms) become definitionally equal
if, for all assignments in $\AFu$, the two types become "essentially"
syntactically equal after substitution of all variables in $\Fu$ by
their assigned natural number. For example, the constraint
$\alpha < \beta$ makes $\UU_\beta$ and $\UU_{\max(1,\beta)}$
definitionally equal.

For decidability, Voevodsky refers in the proof of
\cite[Lemma 2.0.4, proof]{VV} to Presburger Arithmetic,
in which his constraints can easily be expressed.\footnote{%
For this it seems necessary to also require that $\AFu$
is defined by a \emph{finite} set of constraints.}%end footnote
This indeed implies that definitional equality is decidable, even
"in practice [...] expected to be very easily decidable i.e.\
to have low complexity of the decision procedure"
\cite[p.\ 5, l.\ -13]{VV}.
The latter is confirmed by \cite{bezem-coquand:lattices}.

The remaining sections of \cite{VV} are devoted to extending the
type theory with data types, $W$-types and identity types,
and to its metatheory.

We summarize the main differences between our type theories
and Voevodsky's as follows.
%
In \cite{VV}, u-levels are natural numbers, even though u-level
expressions can also contain u-level variables, successor and maximum.
Our levels are elements of an abstract sup-semilattice with a successor
operation.
%
In \cite{VV}, constraints are introduced, once and for all,
at the level of the theory. In our proposal they are introduced
at the level of contexts.
There are no level-indexed products and no constraint-indexed products in \cite{VV}.
%
%
(We also remark that Voevodsky's system is Tarski-style and has cumulativity (rules 29 and 30 in \cite[Section 3.4]{VV}). Our system is also Tarski-style, but we present a Russell-style version in Appendix 2. We present rules for cumulativity in Appendix 1.)

%\item Voevodsky seemingly allowed constraints such as $\alpha<\alpha$.
%Then ${\cal A}$ is empty, which would imply that all types and
%all terms become definitionally equal, respectively.
%Since this is not an interesting type theory,
%we think this case is better excluded and require contexts
%to be loop-free.

%Huet, in an unpublished manuscript \cite{Huet87}, has independently developed an

%cumulative hierarchy indexed by the natural numbers, and to consider instead a family of calculi in which there is some well-founded partial ordering
%of universes. The input language is correspondingly restricted so that specific universes are disallowed; only the anonymous universe Type may be

\paragraph{Sozeau and Tabareau.}

As already mentioned, Sozeau and Tabareau's \cite{SozeauTabareau:coq} work is closely related. The main difference is between their ML-like polymorphim and the explicit polymorphism provided by our level- and constraint-indexed products. Moreover, our constraint languages differ: their constraints are equalities or (strict) inequalities between level variables, while ours are equalities between level expressions generated by the supremum and successor
operations.

Furthermore, they consider cumulative universe hierarchies  \`a la Russell, while
%based on PTS with subtyping. %Universes are called $\Type_i$ with $\Type_i : \Type_{i+1}$. 
our universes are \`a la Tarski and we consider both non-cumulative (like Agda) and cumulative versions.
%and called $\UU_m$ with codes $\UU^m_l : \UU_l $ for $l < m$.
%\item
Moreover, they have special rules for introducing universe-monomorphic and universe-polymorphic constants, and a rule for instantiating the latter. We could have similar rules for adding constants, where we would use our level-abstraction when defining universe-polymorphic constants and our level-application when instantiating them.

%They have the special rule where you conclude $\Type_u = \Type_i$ where a constraint set implies that $u$ is a level expression equal to the level variable $i$. We have level equality judgments $\Gamma \vdash l = m$ and enforce that judgments are invariant under level equality.

Finally, they present a system with an impredicative universe and only $\beta$-conversion, while we present a predicative system with $\eta$-conversion as well.

\paragraph{Assaf and Thir\'e.} 

Assaf \cite{Assaf14} considers an alternative version of the calculus of
constructions where subtyping is explicit. This new system avoids problems related to coercions and dependent types by using the Tarski style
of universes and by introducing additional equations to reflect equality. In particular he adds an explicit cumulativity map $\T^0_1 : \UU_0 \to \UU_1$. He argues that "full reflection" is necessary to achieve the expressivity of Russell style. He introduces the explicit cumulative calculus of constructions (CC$\uparrow$) which is closely related to our system of externally indexed Tarski style universes.
This is analysed further in the PhD thesis of F. Thir\'e \cite{Thire20}.

\section{Conjectures and future work}\label{sec:future}

Canonicity and normalization have been proved for a type theory with an external tower of universes \cite{coquand:tcs2019}. We conjecture that these proofs can be modified to yield proofs of analogous properties (and their corollaries) for our type theories in Section~\ref{sec:internal} and \ref{sec:constraints}.
%
In particular, decidability of type checking should follow using [3].

\eraser{%
0. In the system of Section~\ref{sec:constraints},
there is no context $\Gamma$ such that
one can infer $\Gamma\vdash \UU_\alpha : \UU_\alpha$.
The key is of course that $\Gamma$ is required to be loop-free.
Note that this conjecture is necessary to have normalization.

1. The systems of Section~\ref{sec:internal} and \ref{sec:constraints}
enjoy canonicity, normalization and decidability of type checking.
Since we may have level variables as well as constraints in
the context, care must be taken in formulating canonicity.
For example, if $\Gamma\vdash t:\NN$ and $\Gamma$ consists of only
level variables and constraints, then $t$ is convertible to a numeral.
Once normalization has been established, decidability of type checking
should follow using \cite{bezem-coquand:lattices}.

2. Equivalence between Tarski and Russell formulation

3. Rule 20 on page 17 of \cite{VV} states (in our notation) that
one can derive $A = B : \UU_l$ from $\T_l(A) = \T_l(B)$.
This rule expresses that $\T_l$ is an embedding from the collection
of elements of $\UU_l$ to the collection of types.
We conjecture that this internal rule is admissible
in our system of Section~\ref{sec:constraints}.
Note that the rule is not obviously generalized algebraic,
since it gives rise to a \emph{conditional} equation.
 (A system is generalized algebraic if it can be characterized as an initial model of a generalized algebraic theory in Cartmell's sense \cite{cartmell:apal}.
 See also the paper \cite{bezem:hofmann} for more information about
generalized algebraic theories for dependent type theories and their initial models.)

\section*{Appendix 1: formulation with cumulativity}

%% \subsection*{Rules for cumulativity}

%% With cumulativity, we introduce an operation
%% $$
%% \frac{A:\UU_{n}}
%% {\T_{n}^{m}(A):\UU_{m}}
%% n\leqslant m
%% $$
%% We can also formulate the side condition as an equation $m = n \vee m$.
%% We require for all $n,m$
%% \[
%% \T_m(\T_{n}^{m}(A)) = \T_{n}(A) \quad\text{and}\quad \T_{n}^{m}(\NN^{n}) = \NN^{m}.
%% \footnote{PD: should we not justify the fact that we can have those two rules together? Especially since Erik Palmgren in his work on universe operators has two versions, where the first rule is only admitted in the "uniform constructions" version and the second one in the "full reflection" version. The split arises because in the "uniform constructions" version the cumulativity maps are constructors, whereas in the "full reflection" case they are implicit operations computed by case analysis on the codes. My preferred way to justify both is to take the "full reflections" approach, but note that the rule $\T_m(\T_{n}^{m}(A)) = \T_{n}(A)$ is still valid in the "standard model" (the meaning explanations). Here this rule comes out as an extensional equality, but the rule $\T_{n}^{m}(\NN^{n}) = \NN^{m}$ comes out as a definitional equality. Interestingly, it seems that the resulting system is still normalizing and has decidable judgments. }

%% $$
%% \T_{n}^n(A) = A \quad\text{and}\quad \T_{n}^p\T_{m}^n = \T_m^p.
%% $$
%% We can then simplify the product and sum rules to
%% $$
%% \frac{A:\UU_{n}~~~~~~B:\T_{n}(A)\rightarrow \UU_{n}}
%%      {\Pi^{n} A B:\UU_{n}}~~~~~~~~~
%% \frac{A:\UU_{n}~~~~~~B:\T_{n}(A)\rightarrow \UU_{n}}
%%      {\Sigma^{n} A B:\UU_{n}}~~~~~~~~~
%% $$
%% with conversion rules
%% $$
%% \T_{n}~(\Pi^{n} A B) = \mypi{x}{\T_{n}(A)}{ \T_{n}(B~x)}~~~~~~~
%% \T_{n}~(\Sigma^{n} A B) = \mysig{x}{\T_{n}(A)}{ \T_{n}(B~x)}~~~~~~~
%% $$
%% and
%% $$
%% \T_{n}^{m}~(\Pi^{n} A B) = \Pi^{m} \T_{n}^{m}(A) (\mylam{x}{\T_{n}(A)}{\T_{n}^{m}(B~x)})~~~~~~
%% \T_{n}^{m}~(\Sigma^{n} A B) = \Sigma^{m} \T_{n}^{m}(A) (\mylam{x}{\T_{n}(A)}{\T_{n}^{m}(B~x)})~~~~~~
%% $$

%% These rules are also analogous to the rules for externally indexed universes.
%% For the sake of completeness we give them explicitly.

%% (** Here we do not need the $\vee$-operation **)
%% \footnote{PD: But we use $\vee$ in the rules below.}

We introduce an operation $\T_{l}^{m}(A):\UU_{m}$ if $A:\UU_{l}$
and $l\leqslant m$ (i.e., $m = l\vee m$).\footnote{%
Recall that the equality of universe levels is the one of
sup-semilattice with the $\_^+$ operation.}

We require $\T_{m}(\T_{l}^{m}(A)) = \T_{l}(A)$. Note that this
yields, e.g., $a:\T_{m}(\T_{l}^{m}(A))$ if $a:\T_{l}(A)$.
We also require $\T_{l}^{m}(\NN^{l}) = \NN^{m}$ ($l\leqslant m$),
and $\T_{l}^{m}(\UU_{k}^l) = \UU_{k}^{m}$ ($k<l\leqslant m$),
as well as $\T_{l}^m(A) = A$ ($l=m$)
and $\T_{m}^n(\T_{l}^m(A)) = \T_l^n(A)$ ($l\leqslant m\leqslant n$),
for all $A:\UU_l$.
%Note that this cannot be simplified to $\T_{l}^l(A) = A$
%like $\T_{n}^n(A) = A$ in \cref{sec:internal}.
%The simplified equation would not give, e.g.,
%$\T_{\alpha\vee\beta}^{\beta\vee\alpha}(A) = A$.

We can then simplify the product and sum rules to
$$
\frac{A:\UU_{l}~~~~~~B:\T_{l}(A)\rightarrow \UU_{l}}
     {\Pi^{l} A B:\UU_{l}}~~~~~~~~~
\frac{A:\UU_{l}~~~~~~B:\T_{l}(A)\rightarrow \UU_{l}}
     {\Sigma^{l} A B:\UU_{l}}~~~~~~~~~
$$
with conversion rules
$$
\T_{l}~(\Pi^{l} A B) = \mypi{x}{\T_{l}(A)}{ \T_{l}(B~x)}~~~~~~~
\T_{l}~(\Sigma^{l} A B) =  \mysig{x}{\T_{l}(A)}{ \T_{l}(B~x)}~~~~~~~
$$
and
$$
\T_{l}^{m}~(\Pi^{l} A B) = \Pi^{m} \T_{l}^{m}(A) (\mylam {x}{\T_{l}(A)}{\T_{l}^{m}(B~x)})~~~~~~
\T_{l}^{m}~(\Sigma^{l} A B) = \Sigma^{m} \T_{l}^{m}(A) (\mylam {x}{\T_{l}(A)}{\T_{l}^{m}(B~x)})~~~~~~
$$

Recall the family $\Id^l(A,a,b):\UU_l$ for $A:\UU_l$
and $a:\T_l(A)$ and $b:\T_l(B)$, with
judgemental equality $\T_l(\Id^l(A,a,b)) = \Id(\T_l(A),a,b)$.
We add the judgmental equalities $\T_l^m(\Id^l(A,a,b)) =
\Id^m(\T_l^m(A),a,b)$; note that $a$ and $b$ are well-typed since
$\T_{m}(\T_{l}^{m}(A)) = \T_{l}(A)$.

\medskip

Example. Recall the type $\Eq^{l,l}(A,B):\UU_l$ for $A$ and $B$ in $\UU_l$,
%the exponential $A\rightarrow^l B:\UU_l$ as $\Pi^l~A~(\lambda_{x:\T_l(A)}B)$ and
with judgmental equality
$\T_l(\Eq^{l,l}(A,B)) = \Equiv(\T_l(A),\T_l(B))$.
For $m>l$, a consequence of univalence
for $\UU_m$ and $\UU_l$ is that we can build an element of the type
$$
\Id(\UU_m,\Eq^{m,m}(\T^m_l(A),\T^m_l(B)),\Id^m(\UU^m_l,A,B)).
$$

\section*{Appendix 2: Notions of model and formulation \`a la Russell}

\paragraph{Generalised algebraic presentation.}

In a forthcoming paper, we plan to present some generalised algebraic theories of level-indexed categories with families with extra structure.  The models of these theories provide suitable notions of model of our type theories with level judgments. Moreover, the theories presented in this paper are initial objects in categories of such models.
\begin{remark} \label{app:annotation}
As explained
in \cite{streicher:semtt}, in order to see the theories in this paper as presenting {\em initial} models,
it is enough to use a variation where application $c~a:B(a/x)$ for $c:\mypi{x}{A}B$ and $a:A$
is annoted by the type family $A,B$ (and similarly for the pairing operation). If the theories satisy the normal form property, it can then be shown that also the theories without annotated application are initial.
\end{remark}

%\medskip
\paragraph{Russell formulation.}
Above, we presented type theories with universe level judgments {\em \`a la Tarski}. There are alternative formulations
{\em \`a la Russell} (using the terminology introduced in
\cite{martinlof:padova} of
universes). One expects these formulations to be equivalent to the Tarski-versions, and thus also initial models. For preliminary results in this
direction see \cite{Assaf14,Thire20}.

With this formulation, the version without cumulativity becomes

$$
\frac{A:\UU_{n}}{A~\type}
$$
$$
\frac{A:\UU_{n}~~~~~~B:\UU_m(x:A)}
     {\mypi{x}{A}{B}:\UU_{n\vee m}}~~~~~~~~~
\frac{A:\UU_{n}~~~~~~B:\UU_m(x:A)}
     {\mysig{x}{A}{B}:\UU_{n\vee m}}~~~~~~~~~
$$
$$\frac{l~\Level}{\NN:\UU_{l}}$$
$$
\frac{A:\UU_n~~~~~~a_0:A~~~~~~a_1:A}{\Id(A,a_0,a_1):\UU_n}
$$
$$
\frac{l<n}{{\UU_l}:\UU_{n}}
$$

\medskip

For the version with cumulativity, we add the rules
$$
\frac{A:\UU_{l}~~~~~~l\leqslant n}{A:\UU_{n}}
$$
and the rules for products and sums can be simplified to
$$
\frac{A:\UU_{n}~~~~~~B:\UU_n~(x:A)}
     {\mypi{x}{A}{B}:\UU_{n}}~~~~~~~~~
\frac{A:\UU_{n}~~~~~~B:\UU_n~(x:A)}
     {\mysig{x}{A}{B}:\UU_{n}}~~~~~~~~~
$$

     For $m>l$ the consequence of univalence for $\UU_m$ and $\UU_l$
     mentioned in Appendix~1 can now be written
     simply as
     $$\Id(\UU_m,\Equiv(A,B),\Id(\UU_l,A,B)).$$



\begin{remark}
  In the version \`a la Tarski, with or without cumulativity, terms have unique types, in the sense that if $t : A$ and $t : B$ then $A = B$, by induction on $t$. But for this to be valid, we need to annotate application as discussed in Remark~\ref{app:annotation}.
  Even with annotated application, the following property is not elementary: if $\UU_n$ and $\UU_m$ are convertible then $n$ is equal to $m$. This kind of property is needed for showing the equivalence between the Tarski and the Russell formulation.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \label{uniqueness:without:cumulativity}
If, in a system without cumulativity, we extend our system of levels with a least level 0, then if we restrict $\NN$ to be of type $\UU_0$, and $\UU_n$ to be of type $\UU_{n+1}$ then well formed terms have unique types.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  It should be the case that the above formulation \`a la Russell presents the initial CwF with extra extructure for the standard type formers and a hierarchy of universes, but the proof doesn't seem to be trivial, due to Remark~\ref{uniqueness:without:cumulativity}.
\end{remark}

\eraser{PD: feedback from TYPES 2022. As expected, removing $U_0$ generated most feedback, people don't seem to have thought about this before. Pierre-Marie Pedrot asked about the proof-theoretic strength, but unfortunately I was not able to give a good answer on this immediately, although it is clear that it should be less than or equal to type theory with an external hierarchy with universes. I asked Anton whether it actually has the same strength, and he thought it should not be hard to prove that. I also talked to Mathieu who told me that Coq's checking of universe levels is with respect to a weaker theory than ours: only "less than" and "less than or equal" constraints between level experssions without "max", if I understood him correctly.}
