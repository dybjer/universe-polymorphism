  The goal of this work is to refine a proposal of Voevodsky \cite{VV} 
  for handling universes in type theory.
  We recall first the version of type theory with an externally indexed 
  sequence of universes \`a la Tarski and with and without cumulativity.
  We introduce then an internal notion of universe level.
  We add two new judgment forms: $l\ \Level$ meaning that $l$ is a universe level, 
  and $l = m$ meaning that $l$ and $m$ are equal universe levels, 
  where level expressions are built up from level variables $\alpha$ 
  using a successor operation $l^+$ and 
  a join (supremum, maximum) operation $l \vee m$.
  
  We then extend the type theory with formation rules for level-indexed product 
  types $[\alpha]A$ meaning ``$A$ is a type for all universe levels $\alpha$".
  Furthermore, introduction and elimination rules for such types are given,
  as well as some new computational rules.
  The final theory extends a proposal by Voevodsky for a system with level constraints. 
  We shortly discuss the decision problems for sup-semilattices with
  successor that come with this approach, problems that can be solved in polynomial time.

The system of simple type theory, as introduced by Church \cite{church:formulation},
is elegant and forms the basis of several proof assistants. 
However, it has some unnatural limitations: it is not possible in this system to talk
about an arbitrary type, or about an arbitrary structure. 
It is also not possible to form the collection of e.g.\ all groups, 
as needed in category theory. In order to address these limitations, 
Martin-L\"of \cite{ML71,ML71a} introduced a system with a type $V$ of all types. 
A function $A\rightarrow V$ in this system can then be seen as a family of types 
over a given type $A$, and it is natural in such a system to refine
the operations of simple type theory, exponential and cartesian product, 
to operations of dependent products and sums. 
After the discovery of Girard's paradox in \cite{Girard71}, 
Martin-L\"of \cite{ML72} introduced a distinction between
{\em small} and {\em large} types, similar to the distinction introduced 
in category theory between large and small sets,
and the type $V$ became the (large) type of small types.
The name ``universe'' for such a type was chosen in analogy with the notion of 
universes introduced by Grothendieck to represent category theory in set theory.

Later, Martin-L\"of \cite{martinlof:predicative} introduced a countable tower of universes
$$
\UU_0 : \UU_1 : \UU_2 : \cdots
$$
We refer to the indices $0, 1, 2, \ldots$ as {\em universe levels}. 

Before the advent of univalent foundations, most type theorists expected only the first few 
universe levels to be relevant in practical formalisations. 
This included the expectation that it might be feasible for a user of type theory to 
explicitly assign universe levels to their types, simply adding updated versions of earlier
definitions when they were needed at different levels.
However, the number of copies of definitions does not only grow with the level, 
but also with the number of \emph{occurrences of type arguments} 
in the definition of a type former. (The latter growth could be exponential!)

With the advent of Voevodsky's univalent foundations, the need for universe polymorphism 
has only increased, see for example \cite{VV}. 
One often wants to prove theorems uniformly for any arbitrary universe(s).

The {\em univalence axiom} states that for any two types $X,Y$ the canonical map
$$
\idtoeq_{X,Y} : (X=Y)\to (X\simeq Y)
$$
is an equivalence.
Formally, the univalence axiom is an axiom scheme which is added to Martin-Löf type theory. 
If we work in Martin-Löf type theory with a countable tower of universes, 
each type is a member of some universe $\UU_n$. 
Such a universe $\UU_n$ is {\em univalent} provided for all $X,Y : \UU_n$ the 
canonical map $\idtoeq_{X,Y}$ is an equivalence. 
Let $\UA_n$ be the type expressing the univalence of $\UU_n$, and
$$
\ua_n : \UA_n
$$
for $n = 0,1,\ldots$, be a sequence of constants expressing the instances of the univalence axiom. 
We note that $X = Y : \UU_{n+1}$ and $X\simeq Y : \UU_n$ and hence $\UA_n$ is in $\UU_{n+1}$.
If we have a type of levels, as in the Agda or Lean system,
we can express universe polymorphism as quantification over universe levels.
%% Then we can express univalence of all universes as one typing:
%% $$
%% \ua : (l : \Level) \to \UA_l
%% $$
%% in Agda's notation.

We remark that universes are more important in a predicative framework than in an impredicative one.
Consider for example the formalisation of real numbers as Dedekind cuts, 
or domain elements as filters of formal neighbourhoods, 
which belong to $\UU_1$ since they are properties of elements in $\UU_0$.
However, even in a system using an impredicative universe of propositions,
such as the ones in \cite{Huet87,moura:lean}, there is a need for the use of definitions 
parametric in universe levels.

%{\color{red} Cite Lean \cite{moura:lean}?}

 To deal with this duplication problem Huet \cite{Huet87} and, later,
 Harper and Pollack \cite{HarperP91} introduced {\em universe polymorphism}.
 This "implicit"
 approach to universe polymorphisms however is problematic w.r.t. modularity, as pointed
 out in \cite{Courant02,Simpson04}: one can prove $A\rightarrow B$ in one file, and $B\rightarrow C$ in one other file, while
$A\rightarrow C$ is not valid. In order to cope with this issue, J. Courant \cite{Courant02}
suggested to have explicit level universes, with a sup operation (see also \cite{herbelin05}).
This approach is now followed in Agda and in Voevodsky's proposal \cite{VV}.

Our system complements
\cite{Courant02,VV} by handling constraints on universe levels and having instantiation operations.

 %This is a practical problem since universe level inference can be a costly operation, sometimes more costly than the usual type-checking.

%There is a connection between the dimension of a type and the level of a universe: for example, it is natural to consider the groupoid structure of the first universe, the 2-groupoid structure of the second universe, etc.\footnote{PD: I changed this paragraph. What do you think?}

%The starting point for the present discussions was Escard\'o's \cite{escardo} development of univalent mathematics in the Agda system. His development is {\em universe polymorphic} and makes heavy use of quantification over Agda's type $\Level$ of universe levels. However, the Agda system is not a precisely defined logical system, and we would like to introduce several candidate systems in which Escard\'o's development can be carried out. We will also present a system similar to Voevodsky's universe polymorphic system \cite{VV}. (** MODIFY THIS STAMEMENT AND ALL OTHER REFERENCES TO VV **) In this system there are variables ranging over universe levels and each judgment is made relative to a list of equational constraints between universe level expressions.

An example that uses level-indexed products is the following type which  expresses the theorem that univalence for universes of arbitrary level implies function extensionality for functions between universes of arbitrary levels.
$$
([\alpha]\mathsf{IsUnivalent}\, \UU_\alpha)
\to [\beta][\gamma] \mathsf{FunExt}\, \UU_\beta\, \UU_\gamma
$$

We can define in our system a constant
$$
c~=~\lam{\alpha~\beta}\lambda_{Y:\UU_{\beta}}\Id~{\UU_{\beta}}~Y~ (\Sigma_{X:\UU_{\alpha}}X\rightarrow Y)~~:~~
   [\alpha~\beta][\alpha<\beta]\UU_{\beta} \rightarrow \UU_{\beta^+}
$$

   This is because $\Sigma_{X:\UU_{\alpha}}X\rightarrow Y$ has type $\UU_{\beta}$ in the context

   $$\alpha:\Level,~\beta:\Level,~\alpha<\beta,~Y:\UU_{\beta}$$

   We can further instantiate this constant $c$ on two levels $l$ and $m$, and this will be of type
   $$[l<m]\UU_{m} \rightarrow \UU_{m^+}$$
   and this only can be used further if $l<m$ holds in the current context.

   \medskip


In the current system of Agda, the constraint $\alpha<\beta$ is represented indirectly by
writing $\beta$ on the form $\gamma\vee \alpha^+$ and $c$ is defined as
$$
c~=~\lam{\alpha~\gamma}\lambda_{Y:\UU_{\alpha^+\vee\gamma}}\Id~{\UU_{\alpha^+\vee\gamma}}~Y~ (\Sigma_{X:\UU_{\alpha}}X\rightarrow Y)~~:~~
   [\alpha~\gamma]\UU_{\alpha^+\vee\gamma} \rightarrow \UU_{\alpha^{++}\vee\gamma^+}
$$
   which arguably is less readable.

\paragraph{Plan.} We start by giving the rules for a basic version of dependent type theory with
$\Pi, \Sigma, \NN$, and an identity type former $\Id$.
We then explain how to add an externally indexed countable sequence of universes $\UU_n, \T_n$ \`a la Tarski with or without
cumulativity rules.
We introduce the notion of universe level, and let judgments depend not only on a context of ordinary variables, but also on a list of level variables $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k$, giving rise to a theory with level polymorphism. This is a kind of ML-polymorphism since we only quantify over global level variables. We then further extend the theory with level-indexed products of types $[\alpha]A$.

We present (a variation of) Voevodsky's proposal with constraints between level variables  \cite{VV}, complementing his proposal with a way to eliminate constants introduced with level variables and constraints.
